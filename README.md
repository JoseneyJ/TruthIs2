# TruthIs | Under Construction 
A Christian confessional blog website where users can share their testimonies &amp; confessions in their walk with Christ. 
Creating a community where the user's intrusive thoughts they are afraid to share with the church is safe & showing they are not alone in their journey.

## Tasks
    - Responsive design for various devices.
    - Category-based article organization.
    - Search functionality for articles.
    - Commenting system (if applicable).
    - RSS feed for new posts.

## Tools used: 
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (React)
    - Backend: Node.js (Express)
    - Database: MongoDB
    - Hosting: Vercel
    
## Current issues 
* Connecting to blogs posted via API.
  - This error hinders me from fetching a blog by it's id and posting a blog.
* Keeping a continuous connection to my cluster in Mongodb
  - Hinders and delays every function of the site as a whole.

** Currently looking into replacing MongoDB with PostgreSQL in efforts to avoid connection disruption and expand my experience with swapping databases mid-project **
